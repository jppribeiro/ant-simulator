# Ant Simulator

## About <a name = "about"></a>

My attempt at implementing a simple Ant Simulator using the <a href="https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2">SDL2 Binding for Go</a>.

## Further Developments

* Hunger -> Ants need to return home to eat
* Enemies -> Enemies will appear and eat ants
* Guardians -> Special ants that will respond to warning pheromones and defend the colony

* Obstacles
